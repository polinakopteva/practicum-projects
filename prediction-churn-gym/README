# Description of project "Predicting the probability of churn customers from fitness center"

## Data
Customer data for the previous month before checking the outflow:
* gender;
* living or working in the area where the fitness center is located;
* an employee of the club's partner company (cooperation with companies whose employees can receive discounts on a subscription - in this case, the fitness center stores information about the client's employer);
* the fact of the initial recording within the framework of the "bring a friend" campaign (used a promo code from an acquaintance when paying for the first subscription);
* availability of a contact phone number;
* age;
* time since the first visit to the fitness center (in months).

Information based on the log of visits, purchases and information about the current status of the customer's subscription:
* duration of the current valid subscription (month, 6 months, year);
* the period until the end of the current valid subscription (in months);
* the fact of attending group classes;
* average frequency of visits per week for the entire time since the beginning of the subscription;
* average frequency of visits per week for the previous month;
* total revenue from other fitness center services: cafes, sporting goods, beauty and massage parlors.
* the fact of outflow in the current month.

## Aim and tasks of the project
The network of fitness centers "Bodybuilder-datasaentist" develops a strategy of interaction with clients based on analytical data. Customer churn is a common problem of fitness clubs and other services.
The customer has prepared data that contains data for the month before the outflow and the fact of outflow for a certain month.

**The goal of the project is to analyze data and develop an action plan for customer retention.**

Let's reveal the goal in more detail through **tasks**:
> 1. learn how to predict the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client;

> 2. create typical portraits of clients: identify several of the most striking groups and characterize their main properties;

> 3. analyze the main signs that most strongly affect the outflow;

> 4. formulate the main conclusions and develop recommendations for improving the quality of customer service: target groups of customers; measures to reduce churn; other features of customer interaction.
