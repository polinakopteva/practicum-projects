# Description of project "Study of the Stackoverflow service database"
## Data
6 tables and an ER diagram showing the relationships between them were given.  This database is a StackOverflow service of questions and answers about programming. StackOverflow is similar to a social network â€” users of the service ask questions, answer posts, leave comments and rate other answers.
We worked with the version of the database where data on posts for 2008 is stored, but the tables also contained information about the later ratings that these posts received.
