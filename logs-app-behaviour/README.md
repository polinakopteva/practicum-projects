# Description of project "Behavior of users of the mobile app based on selling groceries"

## Data
For this project, a file was given with the following data:
* event name;
* unique user ID;
* time of the event;
* experiment number

## Aim and tasks of the project
This startup sells food. We want to find out how the users of our mobile application behave.

**The purpose of the project is to study the behavior of users of their mobile app**

To achieve this goal, we will perform the following tasks:
1. Study the sales funnel.
2. Observe the results of A/A/B-experimental.

When studying the **sales funnel/events**, we will answer the following questions to find out **how users reach the purchase**
* How many users reach the purchase, and how many are "stuck" in the previous steps? Which ones exactly?

Using the results of the **A/A/B experiment** we want to find out **which font is better for the app**. 
* Designers wanted to change fonts throughout the app, and managers were afraid that it would be unusual for users. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control ones with old fonts and one experimental one with new ones.

## Used libraries
*pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *scipy*, *plotly*
